<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Guardian Headache Diary is a desktop application to help patients suffering from head pains by providing them a platform to take note or record their episodes. They will be able to view their past recordings and view it in a graph or tabular format. They can send this information to their doctors and work together to form the best treatment.

This project was my first big project in programming and I developed it firstly for my own use, as I was suffering with head pains after my first brain surgery attempting to remove my brain tumor. The idea was to create an application where the user (or patient) can easily input their head pains with minimal hassle. I try to find the balance between the needs of the doctors and the patient. Doctors need a lot of information, while patients do not want to input too many things. I try to find the middleground between the two, so that we can get the best out of both worlds.

This project is in partnership with FKUI, RSCM Kencana, and Medical Media.
